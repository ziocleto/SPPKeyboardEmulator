V5 Released:
- Fixed issue of joystick input not being created if you moved the mouse too fast
- Fixed issue of if you initiated a vault with the mouse too close to the edge of the screen, you would have no room to move the mouse
- Improved sensitivity to more closely match the mouse movement
- Removed the now defunct toggle controls image action
- Changed toggle HUD from "2" to "6" (I know this sounds weird. It's an artifact from an experiment that I noticed after export and didn't find it important enough to go back for)
- Added a quick command menu to the tab key
- Changed DPAD-Down from "space" to "v" as space is now jump

V4 Released:
- Added interpolated mouse movement for a smoooooth ride
- Added increased downard sensitivity to account for having less mouse room to move down against your own wrist. Now feels much better trying to do a dash vault
- Broke the interpolation
- Fixed the interpolation and added it to the camera control too
- Broke the mouse centering and you could initiate vaults with the mouse at the edge of the screen, not leaving you enough room to do the vault
- Fixed the mouse centering
- HUD change. Red ring now turns storror blue when edge is reached, giving feedback that max input in that direction has been reached
- HUD change. Red changed to crimson
- HUD change. A trail of your mouse is left behind whilst at edge of radius (Useful for reverse vaults)
- HUD change. Position moved to be slightly right and up of centre screen. Easier to see in corner of your eye (in my opinion)
- Number 1 (Either on numpad or above your letters) now toggles the controller HUD in game (DPAD-UP)
- Number 2 (Either on numpad or above your letters) now toggles the joystick UI that appears when vaulting

V3:
- Added R to restart level
- RMB now controls camera instead of always pulling it with the mouse
- Can now toggle the emulator using Left Alt. By default it's active (mouse stuck in middle) but if you toggle with Alt, the emulator becomes ignored (mouse is free) until you press alt again
- Improved WASD controls (Basically default but smoother, doesn't slam a hard 90 degree turn when you press A or D going whilst forward)
- Spacebar now lets you change distance of camera

V2:
- Packaged the necessary drivers alongside the emulator
- Press ESC to exit the emulator
- Vault system moved from space bar to LMB

V1:
- Initial release
